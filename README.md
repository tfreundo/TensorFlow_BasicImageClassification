# TensorFlow_BasicImageClassification
An implementation of the TensorFlow Tutorial for BasicClassification using the MNIST Fashion Dataset.
The original tutorial can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification).

# Debugging and Visualization
You can choose from multiple debugging and visualization options which fulfill the purpose of learning and understanding what happens after some important steps.
```
debug_plot_exampleImage = False
debug_plot_trainingdata = False # Plots the first x images from the training data
debug_print_exampleNormalization = False
debug_plot_prediction = False
debug_plot_prediction_imgIndex = 1
```

## debug_plot_exampleImage
This option will plot the first image of the Training Dataset as Colorbar (28x28 pixels with color encoding from 0 to 255)
